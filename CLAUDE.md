# tilth

Rust MCP server + CLI for AST-aware code intelligence. Tree-sitter outlines, symbol search, callers/callees, file-level deps analysis. Replaces grep/cat/find for AI agents with structured, token-efficient output.

## Project structure

```
src/
  main.rs              CLI entry (clap). Dispatches to MCP, map, or single-query mode.
  lib.rs               Public API: classify query → read/search/glob → formatted output.
  mcp/
    mod.rs             MCP server (JSON-RPC on stdio). Embeds SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS + EDIT_MODE_EXTRA via include_str! from prompts/.
    write.rs           tilth_write overwrite/append primitives — create-only guard, O_NOFOLLOW symlink refusal, atomic parent-dir creation.
    tools/
      mod.rs           Tool dispatch hub — path/scope resolution under the absolute-path discipline (anchor_path, resolve_scope), budget application.
      definitions.rs   JSON schema definitions for every MCP tool (tilth_search/read/files/deps/grok/diff/savings/write).
      search.rs        tool_search — symbol/content/regex/callers dispatch, multi-symbol support, scope-warning integration.
      read.rs          tool_read — smart file reads, batch/section/sections slicing, savings tracking.
      write.rs         tool_write — batch writes in hash/overwrite/append modes; hash mode delegates to edit::apply_batch.
      deps.rs          tool_deps — file-level dependency analysis (imports + dependents), bloom-filtered.
      diff.rs          tool_diff — structural diff dispatch (uncommitted/staged/ref/file-pair/patch/log).
      files.rs         tool_files — glob file listing, pattern/patterns batch, scope resolution.
      grok.rs          tool_grok — one-call symbol bundle, default vs full caps.
      savings.rs       tool_savings — session token-savings summary vs a naive-read baseline.
  classify.rs          Query type detection (file path, glob, symbol, content, fallthrough).
  lang/
    mod.rs             Shared language infrastructure: detect_file_type(), package_root().
    outline.rs         Tree-sitter outline extraction: outline_language(), walk_top_level(), get_outline_entries().
    treesitter.rs      Shared AST constants: DEFINITION_KINDS, extract_definition_name(), definition_weight().
    detection.rs       Generated file detection (lockfiles, .min.js) and binary detection.
  diff/
    mod.rs             Structural diff types, source resolution, orchestrator pipeline (diff()).
    parse.rs           Unified diff parser: git diff output → Vec<FileDiff>.
    matching.rs        Three-phase symbol matching: identity → structural hash → fuzzy similarity.
    overlay.rs         Per-file structural overlay: outline old/new, match symbols, attribute hunks.
    format.rs          Progressive-disclosure formatters: overview, file detail, function detail, log, conflicts.
  read/
    mod.rs             File reading with smart view (full vs outline based on token count).
    outline/
      mod.rs           generate() — dispatches to the right outline backend by file type, appends the truncation note when a cap is hit.
      code.rs          Outline string formatting for code files. Uses lang/outline for extraction.
      markdown.rs      Markdown heading-based outlines.
      structured.rs    JSON/YAML/TOML structured outlines.
      tabular.rs       CSV/TSV outline: headers + row count + first 5 / last 3 rows via memchr.
      fallback.rs      head_tail() / log_view() — unknown files and logs with no outline support.
      test_file.rs     Test file detection (suppresses outline noise).
    imports.rs         Import extraction for deps analysis.
  search/
    mod.rs             Search orchestration. Symbol, content, regex, callers search types.
    symbol.rs          AST-based symbol search (definitions first, then usages).
    content.rs         Literal text / regex search via ripgrep internals.
    callers.rs         Structural call-site detection (tree-sitter + memchr pre-filter).
    callees.rs         Callee extraction and resolution for expanded definitions.
    callee_query.rs    Per-language tree-sitter call-expression queries + compiled-Query cache, shared by callers.rs and callees.rs.
    siblings.rs        Sibling symbol surfacing in search results.
    scope.rs           Enclosing-scope lookup: nearest definition at a line, qualified by containing type/module.
    grok.rs            One-call symbol bundle (def + body + callers + callees + siblings + tests).
    deps.rs            File-level dependency analysis (imports + dependents with symbols).
    rank.rs            Result ranking (definition weight, basename boost, context proximity).
    facets.rs          Faceted result grouping (definitions, usages, implementations).
    strip.rs           Cognitive load stripping (comments, blank lines in expanded code).
    truncate.rs        Smart truncation to fit budget constraints.
    alloc.rs           Value-based budget allocation — keeps the highest-value blocks when output exceeds budget, not just positional tail-cut.
    bloom_walk.rs      Shared file-prefilter for relational queries (callers/callees/deps): size gate + bloom-filter pre-check before a full parse.
    glob.rs            File glob search.
    blast.rs           Blast radius — find callers of definitions touched by edits.
  index/
    bloom.rs           Bloom filter cache for fast "file contains symbol?" pre-check.
  cache.rs             OutlineCache — DashMap of path → (mtime, outline). Shared across tools.
  session.rs           MCP session state — tracks previously expanded definitions for dedup.
  edit.rs              Hash-anchored editing (tilth_write hash mode). Hashline verification + atomic apply.
  edit_parse_check.rs  Post-edit tree-sitter parse check — diffs pre/post ERROR/MISSING nodes so tilth_write reports only errors the edit introduced.
  install.rs           `tilth install <host>` — writes MCP config for 6 hosts.
  format.rs            Output formatting helpers.
  budget.rs            Token budget enforcement.
  map.rs               Codebase map generation (CLI only, disabled as MCP tool).
  overview.rs          Project fingerprint for MCP initialization (manifest, languages, modules, deps, git). Instant orientation without a tool call.
  timeout.rs           Per-request wall-clock timeout for sync tool calls — worker thread + bounded channel, tracks abandoned threads on expiry.
  util.rs              atomic_write_bytes() — shared by edit.rs and install.rs.
  types.rs             Shared types (QueryType, Lang, OutlineEntry, etc.).
  error.rs             Error types with exit codes.
npm/                   npm wrapper — postinstall downloads binary, run.js proxies to it.
benchmark/             Evaluation harness (see Benchmarks section below).
prompts/               MCP server instruction source (mcp-base.md + mcp-edit.md). Embedded into the binary at compile time and regenerated into AGENTS.md.
AGENTS.md              User-facing copy of the MCP instructions. Generated from prompts/*.md via scripts/regen-agents-md.sh — do not edit directly.

## Languages supported

Rust, TypeScript, TSX, JavaScript, Python, Go, Java, Scala, C, C++, Ruby, PHP, C#, Swift, Kotlin, Elixir, Bash.
Dockerfile, Make detected but have no tree-sitter grammar (outline returns None).

## Build, test, install

```bash
cargo build --release        # release build
cargo test                   # unit tests (in-source #[cfg(test)] modules)
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings  # lint (--all-targets so test code is linted too)
cargo fmt --check            # format check
cargo install --path .       # install to ~/.cargo/bin/tilth
```

CI runs `fmt --check`, `clippy --all-targets -D warnings`, `cargo test` on every push/PR. Run clippy
with `--all-targets` locally too — without it nothing behind `#[cfg(test)]` is linted at all.

Lint config lives in `[lints.clippy]` in `Cargo.toml`, not as `#![warn(..)]` in `src/lib.rs`. Both
halves are load-bearing: `--all-targets` decides which targets get *compiled*, `[lints]` decides
which get the pedantic config. An inner attribute reaches only its own crate root, so while the
config sat in `lib.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `tests/oracle.rs` and `examples/*` were compiled but never
linted. Add a new lint allow to the Cargo.toml table, not to `lib.rs`.

## Version bumps

Update version in **three** places: `Cargo.toml`, `npm/package.json`, and `Cargo.lock` (via `cargo update --workspace`, which relocks only `tilth` itself). Then tag `v<version>` on main. The release workflow builds with `--locked`, which refuses a lockfile whose recorded version disagrees with the manifest, so all three must agree. `version-check` compares all three against the tag and fails the release in one cheap job before the build matrix starts — it names the file and the fix. Verify with `cargo build --release --locked` before tagging.

Releases publish **two npm names** from the same `npm/` wrapper: the canonical unscoped `tilth` and the org anchor `@plotplot/tilth` (the `publish-npm` job renames the artifact and republishes with `--access public`). Both names have an OIDC trusted publisher on npmjs.com (`jahala/tilth` + `release.yml`), so releases need no token. `@plotplot/tilth` was bootstrapped with a one-time manual publish — npm cannot configure trusted publishing for a package that does not exist yet.

**In a fork, nothing is published.** `publish-npm` and `publish-crate` are both gated on `if: github.repository == 'jahala/tilth'`, because neither the npm names nor the crate belong to a fork. Tagging in a fork runs `version-check` and the five `build` jobs, attaches the platform archives to a GitHub release, and skips both publish jobs — the run still reports success, so read the job list rather than the overall conclusion if you need to know whether a publish happened.

## Benchmarks

Code navigation tasks across 5 repos (Express/JS, FastAPI/Python, Gin/Go, ripgrep/Rust, leveldb/C++). Each task runs headless `claude -p` with a question, checks answer against ground-truth strings. The published result tables in `benchmark/README.md` cover a 26-task subset from the first four repos.

**Setup** (one-time). `setup_repos.py` clones the five real repos at pinned commits; `setup.py` generates the separate synthetic fixture. Tasks against real repos need the first:

```bash
python benchmark/fixtures/setup_repos.py
```

**Run** (from project root — works inside Conductor/Claude Code sessions, `run.py` strips `CLAUDECODE` env var):

```bash
# Full suite: all tasks, baseline + tilth, 3 reps per task
python benchmark/run.py --models sonnet --reps 3 --tasks all --modes all

# Specific tasks
python benchmark/run.py --models haiku --reps 3 --tasks rg_search_dispatch,rg_trait_implementors --modes tilth

# Models: sonnet, opus, haiku, gpt5, o3
# Modes: baseline (built-in tools), tilth (built-in + tilth MCP), tilth_forced (tilth MCP only)
# Tasks: all, or comma-separated names from benchmark/tasks/*.py
```

Hard tasks take 2-5 min each. Run in background for multi-task suites. Do NOT pipe output through `head` or similar — it breaks the pipe and causes timeouts.

**Analyze**:

```bash
python benchmark/analyze.py benchmark/results/benchmark_<timestamp>_<model>.jsonl
python benchmark/compare_versions.py old.jsonl new.jsonl

# Quick check of a results file:
jq -r '[.task, (.correct|tostring), (.total_cost_usd|tostring), (.tool_calls.tilth_search // 0 | tostring)] | join("\t")' benchmark/results/<file>.jsonl
```

Results written to `benchmark/results/benchmark_<timestamp>_<model>.jsonl`. Each line is JSON with: `task`, `mode`, `model`, `correct`, `total_cost_usd`, `num_turns`, `tool_calls` (map of tool name → count), `tool_sequence`, `tilth_version`, `duration_ms`, token counts.

Key metric: **cost per correct answer** = total_spend / correct_count. This is the expected cost under retry (geometric model: `avg_cost / accuracy`).

That model assumes `correct` measures the answer. For the three `leveldb_*` tasks it does not: they declare `requires_tool_use`, so `correct` means answer **and** intended route, and a right answer reached with grep is reported false. Use `answer_correct` for cost-per-correct and for any baseline comparison on those tasks. See "Tasks that guard a specific tilth path" in `benchmark/README.md`.

Task definitions are in `benchmark/tasks/*.py`. Each has `name`, `prompt`, `ground_truth` (required strings), `repo`, and difficulty tier. Hard tasks for testing instruction changes: `rg_search_dispatch`, `rg_trait_implementors`, `gin_servehttp_flow`. Prefer these three for instruction work — `leveldb_corruption_callers` is hard too, but its route requirement makes it fail on route choice in roughly 3 runs of 8, which is noise you don't want when measuring a prompt change.

The harness has unit tests: `python -m unittest discover -s benchmark -p 'test_*.py'`.

## MCP instructions

Server instructions sent via MCP protocol live in `prompts/`:

- `prompts/mcp-base.md` — base instructions for all modes (wired in as `SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS`)
- `prompts/mcp-edit.md` — appended in edit mode (wired in as `EDIT_MODE_EXTRA`)

`src/mcp/mod.rs` embeds both at compile time via `include_str!`. `AGENTS.md` is the user-facing copy; regenerate it via `./scripts/regen-agents-md.sh` after any change so both surfaces stay in lockstep. The byte-lock tests in `src/mcp/mod.rs` (`server_instructions_byte_lock`, `edit_mode_extra_byte_lock`) flag accidental drift and must be updated alongside intentional prompt edits.

Changes to MCP instructions must be surgical — no bloat. Haiku is sensitive to:

- Instruction positioning (top-weighted — put important guidance first)
- Framing ("DO NOT" works better than "IMPORTANT:" for weaker models)
- Concrete examples (tool call patterns, not abstract descriptions)

Test instruction changes with haiku benchmarks on hard tasks (`rg_search_dispatch`, `rg_trait_implementors`, `gin_servehttp_flow`).
